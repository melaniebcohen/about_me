        <h3>Student Biography</h3>
        <p>I was born and raised in Seattle, Washington and have lived here my entire life, apart from a short time spent in Portland, Oregon for school.</p>
        <p>The majority of my career thus far has been spent in sales operations. The past year, however, I moved into a product/program management role at a local startup. Working with devs is a lot more fun than working with salespeople!</p>
        <p>I am attending Code Fellows to gain a deeper understanding of the software development process. I also just really want to learn how to do all of this!</p>
